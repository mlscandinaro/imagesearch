# Image Search Twitter Bot

Image Search Twitter Bot is a bot that will search for possible sources of an image
posted on Twitter. 

This bot was created with the intention to support artists by providing
original sources to artwork posted online, in order to draw
more attention to the original creator rather than accounts that repost other
people's artwork without credit or permission. This will
hopefully combat both art reposting and plagiarism.
